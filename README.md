# NeoPixel Ring Goggles

I took two [NeoPixel Rings with 12 LEDs each](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1643),
put them in some steampunk style welding goggles and designed a minimal
controller board using just an ATtiny85, a capacitor, a resistor and some
connectors.

## More to come

Schematics, board layout and pics will follow at some point.
